## Challenge 1: Help Dennis fund his eco-friendly bike

BootLoader is a mobile app that helps people crowdfund their creative projects. Anyone with an idea, dream, and 2-minute video can post their project on BootLoader. Others then donate money to the project to help bring it to fruition.

Dennis Ridesalot, a BootLoader user, has a new concept for a 3-speed bicycle made from recycled parts with a $20 price point. The BootLoader team wants to send a push notification to their users, prompting them to fund the project. However, they don’t want to send a message to all of their users--only those who they think would be interested.

That’s where you come in. You’re the resident data expert at BootLoader. You’d like to create a visualization that helps answer: what kinds of users would be interested in the bicycle project?

Luckily, you’ve been collecting analytics data on how your users fund projects. You also have software that can send push notification to segments of users, based on attributes like location, age range, gender, and mobile device.

For example, you can send a push notification to all iOS users in Chicago, IL that says “Deep dish lovers unite! Help fund the largest pizza in the world on BootLoader.”

**My answer**: [Help Dennis fund his eco-friendly bike.](https://rpubs.com/milesdwilliams15/592213)
